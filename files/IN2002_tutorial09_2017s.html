a)  What is the order in which the various nodes are visited using breadth first traversal, <br>
starting at node "a"? <br>
 <br> <br>
b)  What is the order in which the various nodes are visited using depth first traversal, <br>
starting at node "a"? <br>
 <br> <br> <br>2. The knight is a chess piece that can move only in L shaped patterns, jumping two squares <br>horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one horizontally. This <br>means that in one move, the knight--shown as an X in the table below--can move to any of <br>the squares marked by an O: <br> <br>

 <br>Now consider a knight on a board composed of the following 3 x 4 squares: <br> <br>
A  b  c <br>
d <br>
E  f <br>
g  h <br>
I <br>
j <br>
k  l <br>

a)  Show using adjacency lists the possible moves the knight can make in the 3X4 board. <br>
 <br> <br>
b)  Show the possible moves of the knight as a simple graph (i.e., showing positions a, b, <br>
... l  as vertices, and the possible moves as edges). You may want to move the vertices <br>around to make the graph clearer. <br>
 <br> <br>
c)  Use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the lowest number of moves from a to b. <br>
i. <br>
Convert the simple graph into a weighted graph. Consider the number of <br>moves; what weight should you assign to each edge? <br>
 <br>
ii. <br>
The initial state of arrays toBeChecked, currDist and predecessor is: <br>

 <br> <br>
Show the state of arrays toBeChecked, currDist and predecessor after each iteration of <br>Dijkstra's algorithm. You may stop when a shortest path has been found from a to b. <br>
