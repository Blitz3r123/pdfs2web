<b>Exercise Sheet 1 </b><br>
 <br> <br>Note that you may not have enough time to finish this during the tutorial slot. Get started, see <br>where you have difficulties, study, ask questions, and try again. You should aim to finish all <br>the questions before the next lecture. <br> <br> <br>1. Consider the following pseudocode : <br>
<i> <br>Function foo(array) <br></i>i  1 <br>WHILE array[i] mod 23 != 0 AND i &lt;= length of array <br>
i  i+1 <br>
Return i <br><i> </i><br>
(a)  Describe in plain English what this algorithm does. <br>(b) What is the time complexity with respect to the array size <i>n </i>of the algorithm described <br>
in the worst case, best case, average case? Justify your answer and state assumptions <br>you make for the average case. <br>
 <br> <br>2. Suppose a program consists of two phases executed one after the other. The program takes <br>a string as input, which may be of any length <i>n</i> . What is the time complexity of the whole <br>program, with the phases being of the following complexities? <br>
(a)  O(<i>n</i>2) and O(<i>n </i>log <i>n</i>) <br>(b) O(log <i>n</i>) and O(<i>n</i>) <br>(c)  O(<i>n</i>) and O(<i>n</i>) <br>
 <br> <br>3. Consider the following pseudocode: <br>
<i> <br>Function foo(k) <br></i>s  1 <br>WHILE k &gt; 0 <br>
s  s * 2 <br>k  k-1 <br>
Return s <br><i> <br></i>(a) What does <i>foo </i>compute? <br>
i. nothing  <br>ii. k2 <br>iii. s * k <br>iv. 2k <br>
 <br>
(b) What is the time complexity of <i>foo </i>with respect to <i>k </i>in the worst case? <br>
i. O(1) <br>ii. O(2k) <br>iii.O(s) <br>iv. O(k) <br>

(c) How is the complexity different for the best or average case? <br>Justify your answers. <br>
 <br> <br>4. Create an algorithm that given an array of integers returns the number of times that the <br>number 100 is present in the array. Then answer the questions below. <br> <br>
(a)  What is the time complexity of your algorithm? Justify your answer. <br>(b) What is its space complexity? Justify your answer. <br>(c)  Would it make a difference if the input array was sorted? Justify your answer. <br>
 <br> <br>5. Consider the following pseudocode: <br><i> </i><br>
<i>Function bar(k) <br></i>WHILE k &gt; 0 <br>
i  k <br>s  0 <br>WHILE i &gt; 0 <br>
s  s + i <br>i  i -1 <br>
array[k]  s <br>k  k ­ 1 <br>
Return array <br><i> <br></i>(a) What does <i>bar </i>compute? <br>
i. [] <br>ii. [1,2,3, ... , k] <br>iii. [1,1+2,1+2+3, ... , 1+ ... +k] <br>iv. k * s <br>
 <br>
(b) What is the time complexity of <i>bar </i>with respect to <i>k </i>in the worst case: <br>
i. O(1) <br>ii. O(s) <br>iii. O(k) <br>iv. O(k2) <br>
 <br>
(c) Is the complexity different for the best or average case? <br> <br>
(d) How could the computation in <i>bar </i>be done in a more efficient way? (You need to <br>remember your Maths knowledge to do this. This link will help: http://www.cut-the-<br>knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/GaussSummation.shtml ). Justify your answers. <br>
