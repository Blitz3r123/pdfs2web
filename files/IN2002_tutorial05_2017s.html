<b>Exercise Sheet 5 </b><br>
 <br> <br>1. Work out (using pictures) what the following procedure does on circular lists: <br> <br>public void modify(CList list) { <br>
if (! isEmpty()) { <br>
Node tmp = tail.next; <br>tail.next = tail.next.next; <br>tmp.next = tmp; <br>
} <br>
} <br> <br>Consider the cases where the list has more than one node, only one node, or no nodes. <br> <br> <br>2. Write functions that return the maximum of the numbers of  (where the info in each node is <br>a number): <br> <br>
a)  a circular list <br>b)  a doubly linked list <br>
 <br> <br>3. Write a procedure to swap the first two nodes of a doubly linked list. <br>Have you covered all the cases? <br> <br> <br><b>And a bit of programming. You are not expected to tackle this during the tutorial <br>slot, but at some later time, at your own convenience. </b> <br> <br>4. Write a program that takes as input two ordered circular lists and produces a third ordered <br>circular list containing the elements from both of the input lists. <br> <br>
