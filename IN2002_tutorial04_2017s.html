 <br> <br>1. Suppose we have Node p and Node q referring to the same list of nodes containing <br>[5, 8, 3]. Draw the list, and the results of the following statements, applied in order: <br> <br>p.next = null; <br>p = null; <br> <br> <br>2. Suppose we have Node p referring to a list of nodes containing [3, 5, 4, 1]. Draw <br>the list, and the results of the following statements, applied in order: <br> <br>p.next = p.next.next; <br>p.next = new Node(7, p.next); <br>p.next.next = new Node(8); <br>p.next.next = p; <br> <br> <br>3. Work out (using pictures) what the following procedure does: <br> <br>public void modify(SLList list) { <br>
if (list.head != null &amp;&amp; list.head.next != null) { <br>
Node tmp = list.head.next; <br>list.head.next = tmp.next; <br>tmp.next = list.head; <br>list.head = tmp; <br>
} <br>
} <br> <br> <br>4.  <br>a) Write a method that checks whether two singly linked lists have the same elements (in any <br>order). You should not modify either list. What time (in big-O notation) does this method <br>take? <br> <br>b) What would be the time complexity if you were checking whether the lists have the same <br>elements in the same order? <br> <br> <br>
