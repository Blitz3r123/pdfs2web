<b>Exercise Sheet 6 </b><br>
 <br> <br>1. Demonstrate the insertion of the keys 5, 28, 19, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table of 9 <br>slots. The hash function is h(k) = k mod 9, and collisions are resolved by chaining. How <br>much difference would it make if the keys were presented in a different order? <br> <br> <br>2. Demonstrate the insertion of the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 17, 20, 16 and 30 into a hash table of <br>11 slots, with hash function h(k) = k mod 11, and collisions resolved by open addressing, <br>using a) linear probing, and b) quadratic probing. What are the average and worst cases for <br>search? <br> <br> <br>3. Write delete for a hash table with chaining. <br> <br> <br>4. Suppose we have a hash table of size m, with hash function h(k) = k mod m, and with <br>collisions resolved by chaining. Suppose further that all the keys we will insert divide evenly <br>by 4 (for example, they are pointers on a certain architecture). What happens if m is 20? 19? <br>18? In general, which values of m give better performance? <br>
