<b>Exercise Sheet 7 </b><br>
 <br> <br>1. Write out a preorder, inorder, postorder and breadth-first traversals of the following binary <br>tree: <br> <br>
6<br>
11<br>
17<br>
15<br>
13<br>
12<br>
16<br>
1<br>
9<br>
3<br>
8<br>
2<br>
7<br>
10<br>
 <br>
 <br>Indicate the contents of the node visited and the stack/queue at each point in the preorder, <br>inorder, postorder and breadth-first traversals. <br> <br> <br>2. Write a recursive function that reverses the order of the nodes in each level of a binary tree. <br> <br> <br>3. Write a non-recursive function using a stack to compute the size of a binary tree. <br> <br> <br>4. Show the binary search tree that results from inserting the following sequence of keys: 6, <br>3, 11, 9, 8, 5, 4, 2, 12, 7, 1, 10. <br> <br> <br>5. What kind of tree is produced if the same keys are inserted in ascending order? What if <br>they are inserted in descending order? <br> <br> <br>6. A possible sorting algorithm is to add all the keys of an array to a binary search tree and <br>then read off its inorder traversal. Is this related to any of the sorting algorithms previously <br>considered? <br> <br> <br>7. Show the tree that results from the tree built in exercise 4 if you delete10? What if you <br>deleted 3 instead? <br> <br> <br> <br>
